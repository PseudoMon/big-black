# Big Black
## The blog theme with big text and two colours

[Look at it live!](https://pseudomon.github.io/big-black) It's also available in two additional colors, inspired by (i.e. taken straight out of) *Return of the Obra Dinn*. Add `?color=obradinn` or `?color=ibm` to the end of the url to see it.

Read its [about](https://pseudomon.github.io/big-black/about.html) page.

## Reasoning
Big Black is a blog theme I made for various reasons: 

1) I am tired of web designs that are aesthetially pleasing but have tiny tiny tiny text, 

2) I am tired of how bloated modern web development has become and wanted to take the time to build something by hand, frameworks and preprocessors be damned, and 

3) I am tired of my own inability to design websites, so one day I decide to throw my expectations out of the window and just design something for its own sake. 

Also brutalism is a pretty cool design philosophy.

## If you want to use this
Big Black is currently only available as plain HTML and CSS files. It's released under GNU GPLv3, so you're free to take that and modify it to fit your own website, as long as cite the original source and release the modification under the same license.
